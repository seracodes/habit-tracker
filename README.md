# 🌱 Habit Garden — A Cute CLI Habit Tracker

Welcome to **Habit Garden**, a cozy little command-line habit tracker I built as part of my Python programming learning journey 🌸

This project proves that even without fancy graphics or apps, software can still feel warm, human, and motivating — with streaks, persistence, and tiny doodles cheering you on as you grow better habits 🌿
---

## ✨ What It Can Do

- 🌱 Add habits
- ✅ Mark habits complete
- 🔥 Track streaks
- 💾 Save everything automatically
- 🛡️ Recover safely from errors
- 🎨 Show cute ASCII doodles for motivation
- 📒 Store habits locally using JSON

All inside your terminal — simple, fast, and distraction-free.

## 🚀 How To Run
Make sure Python is installed, then:

🧭 Commands
add <habit>      → Add a new habit
done <habit>     → Mark habit complete
list             → Show all habits
delete <habit>   → Delete a habit
help             → Show commands
exit             → Quit the app

🌸 Why I Built This
This project was built as part of my journey to understand:
How programs think
How data is stored and saved
How command-line tools work
How to design systems, not just write code

It’s small, but thoughtfully engineered — and designed to feel kind to the user ✨

🔮 What’s Next
I plan to expand this with:
Daily reminders
Streak celebrations
Habit analytics
Themed CLI designs
And more cozy features 🌷
